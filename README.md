## Miniproject descripton

For this mininproject we decided to create a small doulingo-like spanish learning website in which the user takes quizzes and receives their score back. The lessons have difficulties to them and all the questions are multiple choice. Also you have to log in after creating a super user and your grades are tracked.

Once you commit and submit your work to Github, I'll update this section with feedback.
